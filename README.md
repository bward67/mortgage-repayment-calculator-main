So this was fun. The thing that gave me the most trouble was the lime colored outline on the radio buttons when they are checked. First I tried changing the accent-color to hex #d7da2f which is the equivalent of the lime hsl color in the style guide but that only changed the inside and not the border. Interestingly, when I changed the accent-color to red it DID change both the border and the inside circle to red. But after some playing around with it and some googling, I went with 2 pseudo-elements: (when .checked) one :after the input for the inside circle and another :before the words repayment and interest-only for the outside circle.

I googled to get the function for the monthly repayments calculation and then used what little "logic" I actually have to get the other calculations.

To get the commas for the large numbers I tried my heart out with .toLocaleString() but the whole - is it a number or is it a string thing nearly did my head it. I had more console.logs than I have ever had before and typeof's to try to figure out what was going on. In the end, I recalled Wes Bos and his JS30 project - Type Ahead - and I "borrowed" his function for numberWithCommas which did the trick.
